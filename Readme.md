# Meteorological Influence on Gas Flaring Emissions Dispersion from the Hibernia Platform in Newfoundland and Labrador

## Overview

This project investigates the impact of meteorological conditions on the dispersion of gas flaring emissions from the Hibernia Platform, an offshore oil platform located in Newfoundland and Labrador. The study aims to understand how different weather patterns affect the spread of pollutants and their subsequent impact on local air quality, and  health.

## Pico Framework

**Population** :

* The geographic area around the Hibernia Platform in Newfoundland and Labrador.
* Residents and ecological systems affected by the gas flaring emissions.

 **Intervention** :

* Analysis of meteorological conditions (e.g., wind speed, wind direction, temperature, humidity) and their influence on the dispersion of gas flaring emissions.

 **Comparison** :

* Comparison of emission dispersion patterns under different meteorological conditions.

**Outcome** :

* Understanding the extent and direction of emission dispersion under various meteorological conditions.
* Assessment of the impact of these emissions on local air quality and potential health/ecological implications.


## Methodology

This section outlines the approach and methods used to analyze the impact of meteorological conditions on the dispersion of gas flaring emissions from the Hibernia Platform.

### Data Collection

* **Emission Data** : Collection of detailed emission data from the Hibernia platform, including types of pollutants (such as \SOtwo, \NOx, and \PMtwoFive), emission rates, and flaring events.
* **Meteorological Data** : Gathering of local meteorological data, including wind speed, direction, temperature, and humidity, crucial for dispersion modeling.

### Modeling Approach

* **Dispersion Model** : Utilization of the AERMOD atmospheric dispersion model to simulate the dispersion of emissions under various meteorological conditions. AERMOD is chosen for its ability to handle complex terrain and varying atmospheric conditions.
* **Scenario Analysis** : Simulation of different meteorological scenarios to observe how changes in weather patterns affect the dispersion of pollutants.

### Data Analysis

* **Spatial Analysis** : Analysis of the spatial distribution of pollutants to identify areas with potentially high concentrations.
* **Statistical Analysis** : Application of statistical tools to compare dispersion under various meteorological conditions and quantify the impact on air quality.

### Validation

* **Model Validation** : Comparison of model outputs with available air quality monitoring data to validate the accuracy of the dispersion model.
* **Sensitivity Analysis** : Conducting sensitivity tests to understand the influence of various input parameters on the model outputs.

### Outcome Assessment

* **Impact Analysis** : Assessment of the potential health impacts based on the concentration and distribution of pollutants.
* **Risk Communication** : Preparation of detailed maps and reports to communicate risks to local authorities and the public.
